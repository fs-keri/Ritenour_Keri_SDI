4 Types of code:
    1- Sequential - lines by line; in order (expressions)
    2- Conditional - allows code to let computer run based on certain situations (if statement, ternaries)
    3- Reusable - allows us to have code that is written once, but able to be used again and again by the machine (functions)
        - DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself


Functions are for storage
    A variable stores values
    Functions store blocks of code

  Functions are best though of as little factories, designed to do a task (stuff goes in, stuff can come out)

  Ways to think about functions:
    -references to another receipe you might use many times
    -instead of printing the same recipe in many pages of a recipe book, you reference the frosting on a different page number
    -In games, functions allow you to have code in one place and run that code as many times as you want

Functions - blocks of code that run processes for you.

Different types of functions:
    -Functions - a.k.a "Normal Function"
    -Procedures
    -Anonymous Functions


Basic Structure
    function functionName(){
        //code the function runs
    }
        *curly braces are for blocks of code to be executed
        *parentheses are for parameters or can be empty

        Instead of "if" we are going to use the keyword "function"

        Functions have names so we can refer to them later
