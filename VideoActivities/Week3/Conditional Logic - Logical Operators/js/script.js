//Equality == compares two "is this the same"  a==b

//Assignment = stores values  a=b "changes the value and stores it"

//Strict Equality === "the same value and the same type"
    // 6 == "6" TRUE
    // 6 === "6"  FALSE (one is a number and one is a string)

    //Use Strict Equality over Equality === is better and faster than ==

//Inequality != "is not the same as"
