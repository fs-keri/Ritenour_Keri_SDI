/*
 A bunch of students are having a party and somebody ordered pizza. Create an expression that calculates how much pizza each partygoer will get at the party. (Assume all pizzas have the same number of slices and that the person dividing the pizza is really precise, so this can be a decimal, like 3.52 slices, etc.)

    Number of slices per pizza
    Number of people at the party
    Number of pizzas ordered.

 Result Variables:
    Number of slices per person. (Can be a decimal or floating point).

 Result to Print:
    “Each person ate X slices of pizza at the party.”
