Relational Operators

    Greater than >
    Less than    <
    Greater than or equal to >=
    Less than or equal to    <=

    The purpose of relational operators is to compare
    two (and only two) values or variables.

    The comparison results in TRUE or FALSE.

    With the result, the computer can make a decision like the
    if statements we have been talking about.


Equality Operators

    Equality ==  (allows you to compare two values and see if they are holding the same amount)
    Strict Equality ===  (used not only when you want to compare the value of two objects, but their type as well)
    Inequality !=

    They also compare two objects and come up with a true or
    false, like the relational operators.

    (note be using in this class. It is not the best way to get
    things done in JavaScript)


var a =12;
a > 20  FALSE

Symbols should never be broken such as < =, they must be
together as <=.

5 < 5 FALSE
5 <= 5 TRUE

a==b (is a the same as b)
a=b (changes the value of a)

6 Number
"6" String
6 == "6" TRUE
6 === "6" FALSE (because one is a number and one is a string)
(checks to see if these are two strings or are they two numbers)


BEST PRACTICE USE STRICT EQUALITY OVER EQUALITY
=== IS BETTER THAN ==
It is more efficient

Inequality -- uses the != operator

    to evaluate if two objects are different (is not the same)
    Do this task only if a!=b TRUE
