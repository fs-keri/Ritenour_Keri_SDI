/*
 Variables are like boxes and declaring a variable is making a box.
 Declaring a variable is storing something inside that box.

 storage container = value  (the storage container is always on the left
 and the value is always on the right)
 */

var yearOfBirth = 1970; //declaring and defining on same line

/*
 declare your variable before you define it
 as a rule a number is anything that can be calculated or used
 to be calculated in the future.
