/*
 Variables are like boxes and declaring a variable is making a box.
 Declaring a variable is storing something inside that box.

 storage container = value  (the storage container is always on the left
 and the value is always on the right)

var yearOfBirth = 1970; //declaring and defining on same line

/*
 declare your variable before you define it
 as a rule a number is anything that can be calculated or used
 to be calculated in the future.
 */

/*Boolean variable - they are the simplest and smallest pieces of data
  They are either on or off they store either true or false
 */

var isStudent = true;

var firstName = "Keri"; //you can use single or double quotes as long as your are consistant

var phrase = 'I don\'t know'; /* in this instance you can use the escape operator that tells the machine
 to ignore certain characters so here you would use the backslash
  */

var phrase = 'I don\'t know \n You\'ll have to speak to the Professor';/*the backslash n creates a new line
  or line break
  */
